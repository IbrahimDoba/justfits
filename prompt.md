### TASK OVERVIEW

I want you to analyze and replicate the **visual motion, animations, layout flow, and typography style** of the following Dribbble showcase:

👉 https://dribbble.com/shots/25931151-Vexo-eCommerce-website

This Dribbble shot contains a **video**.  
You must:

- Watch the video carefully
- Break down every animation, transition, interaction, and layout pattern
- Understand the pacing, easing, scroll behavior, and typography hierarchy

Then, **recreate that same design language and animation philosophy** for a real production e-commerce website called **JUSTFITS**.

- Confident
- Minimal but bold
- Street-luxury aesthetic
- Designed for car lovers and style-conscious men

Products:

The site must feel:

- **Prisma ORM**

Follow **enterprise-level architecture**:

### WHAT I WANT YOU TO PRODUCE

Include:

Explain the responsibility of each layer.

---

#### 4️⃣ ANIMATION IMPLEMENTATION

Provide **real Framer Motion examples**, such as:
